# Deploying Machine Learning Model using Streamlit

This repository demonstrates how to deploy a Machine Learning model to predict loan eligibility using Streamlit, a Python framework for creating interactive web applications.

## Overview
This project implements a Machine Learning model to predict loan eligibility based on user inputs such as gender, marital status, applicant income, and loan amount. The model is deployed as a web app using **Streamlit** and is accessible via a public URL using **ngrok**.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- Pyngrok
- Pandas
- Numpy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/streamlit-loan-prediction.git
   cd streamlit-loan-prediction


# Big Mart Sales Prediction Application
This repository contains a machine learning project to predict sales for Big Mart stores using historical sales data. The application is built with Python and deployed using Streamlit to create a simple and interactive user interface.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Prepares the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Model Building: Utilizes machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Trees, or XGBoost to predict sales.

User Interface: A Streamlit web app where users can input specific details to predict sales for Big Mart stores.

Evaluation: The model performance is evaluated using metrics like RMSE and accuracy.

# Application Workflow
Data Loading: Load and preprocess the data for analysis.

Feature Engineering: Extract important features such as product type, store size, and store location.

Model Training: Train a predictive model using advanced regression techniques.

Web Interface: The Streamlit application allows users to input various parameters and receive predictions on expected sales.

# Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/big-mart-sales-prediction.git

cd big-mart-sales-prediction

pip install -r requirements.txt


# Open your browser at http://localhost:8501 and interact with the application by entering the relevant data points for sales prediction.
# Dependencies
