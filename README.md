# Deploying Machine Learning Model using Streamlit

This repository demonstrates how to deploy a Machine Learning model to predict loan eligibility using Streamlit, a Python framework for creating interactive web applications.

## Overview
This project implements a Machine Learning model to predict loan eligibility based on user inputs such as gender, marital status, applicant income, and loan amount. The model is deployed as a web app using **Streamlit** and is accessible via a public URL using **ngrok**.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- Pyngrok
- Pandas
- Numpy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/streamlit-loan-prediction.git
   cd streamlit-loan-prediction
